The Administrative KCA is the heart of the IDeA-CTR program. We provide exceptional leadership and coordinate the successful day-to-day operations necessary to fulfill our shared vision: shaping a robust infrastructure for advancing clinical and translational science in the Great Plains region.   



Our industrious [Steering Committee](https://test-gpctr.unmc.edu/about-us/steering-committe-kca-operations/) meets on a monthly basis to expertly oversee governance, policy, and procedural issues related to the management of all IDeA research and educational activities and services.  



The Administrative KCA also oversees communications, budget management, committee organization and meetings, and the facilitation of innovative collaborations within our network and our communities. 



We value transparency and welcome input from all of our partners, community members, and program participants. Our [Tracking & Evaluation KCA](https://test-gpctr.unmc.edu/cores/tracking-evaluation-kca/) gathers and provides feedback that further informs ongoing improvement, and we routinely seek guidance from both [Internal](https://test-gpctr.unmc.edu/about-us/internal-advisory-committee/) and [External Advisory Committee](https://test-gpctr.unmc.edu/about-us/external-advisory-committee/)s to solve problems, revise goals, and realign resources as opportunities arise.
